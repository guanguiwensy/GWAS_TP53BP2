The first step of SNPs quality control was perform by using 'SNP_quality_control.sh'.

Further step of SNPs quality control and association analysis were perform according to https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA_tutorial.

Manhattan plot (Figure 1A), quantile quantile plot (Sup figure 1D) and inflation factor were perform using 'Manhattan_plot_QQ_plot.R'.

The locusroom map (Figure 1B) of SNPs near rs7519753 on Chr 1 was drawn through the online platform of locuszoom [https://my.locuszoom.org/]

Population substructure was characterized using principal component analyses by plink2. And the plot were plotted by using 'MDS_own.R' and 'MDS_merged.R' (Sup figre 1A-1C).

Frequencies map of rs700021 C allele derived from the 1000 Genomes Project was plotted using 'Global_SNP_distribution_map.R' (Sup figure 7).
